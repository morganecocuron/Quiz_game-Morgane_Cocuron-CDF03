# Quiz_game-Morgane_Cocuron-CDF03

What is the objective of the project?
The objective of the project is to develop a console application that runs in the terminal. I chose to work on a quiz game where the user has to answer a series of questions. The project uses an API to generate questions with specific difficulty levels, categories, and types. If the user answers all the questions correctly, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose.

How to run the project?
You can find the entire project in the dedicated GitHub repository. First, download the project's zip file to your local computer and extract it. Next, open the Anaconda application (which should already be installed on your computer) and launch Spyder. Then, open the main Python file of the game called quiz_game_dvp.py located in the extracted folder. You can now run the code, and the game will execute directly in the console.

How to contribute?
Once you have installed the project locally, you can contribute to it. You can improve the source code, add new features to the game, or make changes to the README file, for example. Here is how to contribute:

Open your command prompt and navigate to the specific folder where the project is located.
Clone the GitHub repository using the following command:
git clone "link_to_the_GitHub_repo"
After cloning, create and switch to a new branch for each modification. You can fetch all the remote branches using:
git fetch origin
Check out the specific branch you want to work on:
git checkout name_of_the_branch
Add the new files or changes using:
git add .
Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
git commit -m "Description of the changes"
Push your changes to the remote repository:
git push origin name_of_the_branch
After pushing your changes, go to the "Pull Requests" section on GitHub. There, you can create a pull request and merge your changes into the main branch. Make sure your modifications are visible in the GitHub repository after the merge.
